C-PROGRAMMING
# DISCLAIMER: 
- I will be using vi editor throughout my learning journey in exploring C programming as well as betty linter for code formatting. Feel free to use your favourite editor :)
## According to me Why C?
- I can't deny the fact that over the years I have felt in love with other languages like Typescript, Java, Javascript and their respective frameworks, but then I once again found love in C for the obvious reasons;
- Guys who doesnt what to build their own compilers and probably write their own  OS someday, for me I want that, I like that. I have come to realize the power of C through lots of articles and passion has drove me to realizing that I need C to understand even more advance concepts like pointers and memory management.
- Through this learning phase I know it will period of lots of failures and trials but in the end I will triumph.
- I will be using the free tutorials and books I find useful online and gradually add their links here.
- Every folder inside this repo is going to be building on to the next concepts, starting from the easy concepts to more advanced topics.
- Feel free to contribute.
